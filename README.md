Contact: matthew.lew008@gmail.com

The purpose of this project is to store and encrypt user passwords into an sqlite database and allow users to add and delete entries using the GUI
The code is primarily split into the backend.py file and the GUI.py file that handle the back and front end respectively

Files developed by me: backend.py, GUI.py, PasswordManager.py

Developed with: Cryptography, sqlite3, PyQt6

Future planned updates
 1. Confirm Password Screen
 2. Text to * for passwords
 3. Add delete and change password buttons in each row
 4. Update the table upon changing data
